## Requirements

This Django application requires the following:

* Django 1.3.1 and above: it was built against 1.3.1, but may work with other versions of 1.3.
* sorl thumbnail [http://thumbnail.sorl.net](http://thumbnail.sorl.net)
* django tiny mce [http://code.google.com/p/django-tinymce/](http://code.google.com/p/django-tinymce/)

### Media URLs

To use tiny mce in the admin, create a symbolic link to the media/tiny_mce directory located in the python site package for tinymce (or just copy the media/tiny_mce directory to the site's media directory). Once this is done, make sure the setting for `TINYMCE_JS_URL` is correct.

In the media directory, add a symbolic link to `blog/media` - name this link `blog_media`.
